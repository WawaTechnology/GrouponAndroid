        ① If the return is caused by the product quality or the mistake from us, you will be guaranteed to get 100% refund.\n
② We offer a 24hours return policy.\n\n

1. Return and exchange situation caused by the customer\'s personal reasons：\n
① Personal taste preference;\n
② Product color perception difference;\n
③ Return without any reason (when the product and packaging are intact);\n
④ After dismantling the package, as long as the main body of the product is in good condition, you can contact customer service to return the goods without affecting the second sale.\n\n

2. Return and exchange situation caused by EBuyMart：\n

① When the product received is not the ordered product, please provide the order number or your mobile phone number to follow up the return service;\n
② For the quality of the product itself, please provide the order number or your mobile phone number to provide after-sales service.\n\n


3. Refusal to return any of the following conditions：\n

① When there is a quality problem in the product, the customer discards or consumes the product. Then make a complaint consultation;\n
② The product is not sold by EBuyMart after inspection by the EBuy staff;\n
③ The product exceeds the specified service time within 24 hours.\n\n

4. Return and exchange tips：\n

① Chilled perishable goods and vegetables do not enjoy the "24-hour return" service, if there are product quality problems in the face, you can directly refuse;\n
② When returning the goods, you need to return the corresponding invoice (if has) to ensure that the EBuy staff can verify and quickly process;\n
③ The refund will be refunded in the original payment method;\n
④ EBuyMart pictures and information are for reference only. The products are subject to the actual product. The shooting light and the color difference of the display may cause a slight difference between the product and the picture, which is not a quality problem. After the order transaction is successful, please save the invoice (if has), so that after the quality problem is found within the specified time, the after-sales service can be carried out normally.\n\n
5. Exclusive customer service - Have problems, Easily retreat\n
